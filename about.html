        <p> <span class="bold">As a child, I used to love going to museums and art galleries</span> to explore different kinds of art.<br>
            It amazes me how different styles can still be considered as an art form. Even a simple smudge of paint can mean<br> a thousand words.<br><br> 
            
            <span class="bold">Perception is the key to seeing the beauty in art.</span> Being in the moment, understanding the artist's meaning and<br> expressions. It can tell you a story and it can simply be beautiful in its own way.<br><br>
            
            <span class="bold">I finished college in the University of the Philippines</span> with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts Major in Painting.<br><br>
            
            Now, aspiring to be a well known artist from the province of Nueva Ecija. </p>
